  - title: "Identifying Wine types from Description : Text Classification with LLM/ML and Error Analysis"
    authors:  Wine reviews were used to determine the type of wine with the goal of creating a wine recommendation
     system  based on user's description of taste preference. Training was performed on an imbalanced dataset using classification
     algorithms like <i>SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier</i>. <i>Neural Network (CNN, RNN and LSTM)</i> and <i>LLM models (DistilBERT and RoBERTa)</i>
     were also used along with Natural Language Processing to clean and tokenize the unstructed data.Error analysis was done using *SHAP*.

  - title: "Deep Learning Based Recipe Discovery and Recommendation"
    authors: Deep learning and Natural Language Processing used to develop an automated system capable of
      accurately recognizing a wide range of fruits and vegetables from their images using advanced
      Vision Transformer. The methodology involves the use of transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained
      vision models on the Fruits and Vegetables dataset from Kaggle followed by NLP to offer
      personalized recipe recommendations based on the identified ingredients.

  - title: "Predicting Crime Resolution in Los Angeles using Machine Learning"
    authors: This project uses LAPD crime data to train a model on crime type, location, premise and time of occurance along with victim details. Supervised machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost have been used to determine if a certain crime 
      will reamin unresolved along with the probability of resolution.
