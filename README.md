# _Welcome to my website!_

I am a _graduate student_ currently pursuing *MS in Big Data Analytics* at SDSU. 
I have *3+ years of work experience* executing data-driven solutions for strategic business decisions.I have displayed proficiency in large scale exploratory data analysis, structured and unstructured data mining, feature engineering, machine learning, performance optimization and data visualization.
I see myself as a _comprehensive problem solver_ with hands-on experience in the application of advanced statistical techniques, model building â€šruntime-monitoring and insight generation.
I look forward to contributing to the ongoing growth and improvement of this field. While *Python* is my go-to language for most things, the following summarizes my skill set as of now -

``Technical Skills: *Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Seaborn and Scikit-learn), SQL, Excel, Unix, Data Visualization Interactive Dashboard Interfaces*``

``Statistical Techniques: *Forecasting, Regression Analysis, Decision Tree Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Pattern Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Time Series Analysis, , Cluster Analysis, Segmentation*``

``Machine Learning Algorithms - *Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines* ``

I belive in learning everyday.I am happy to collaborate and discuss on any topic related to Data Science and Big Data.
Please feel free to go through my projects and leave comments(if any).

***Best,***
